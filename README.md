## :ledger: Javascript Projects Collection by Vinicius Cardoso

![Javascript Vinicius Cardoso](./js-logo.png)
A collection of some my projects building with focus on JavaScript the pure language üëç

These applications are:

- great for improving my coding skills :muscle:;
- great for experimenting with new technologies üÜï;
- great for adding to my portfolio :file_folder:;
- great for using as examples in tutorials (articles or videos) :page_with_curl:;
- easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features :ok_hand:;

Each project has the following **features**:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. A list of _User Stories_ which should be implemented (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of _To-Do's_. Feel free to add your own stories if you want);
3. A list of bonus features that not only improve the base project, but also your skills at the same time (these are optional and should be attempted only after you have completed the required user stories)
4. All the resources and links to help you find what you need to complete the project


## Projects

Projects are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience
required to complete them.
